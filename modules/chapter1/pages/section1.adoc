= Automation Mesh

One thing is common in every application that needs to scale the operation globally i.e communication between the application and for this Ansible automation platform has Automation Mesh. 

An automation mesh is an overlay network designed to enable the allocation of work among a sizable and scattered group of workers known as execution nodes by means of nodes that link to one another peer-to-peer via pre-existing networks and receptor is the service that helps with the maintenance of this network. 

Automation mesh communicates have TLS encryption, which encrypts traffic traveling across external networks, such as the internet which helped the Ansible automation platform to achieve the below landmarks: 

- Nodes may be created, registered, grouped, ungrouped, and deregistered with less downtime thanks to dynamic cluster capacity that increases independently. 					
- Control and execution plane separation that enables you to scale playbook execution capacity independently from control plane capacity. 	
- Deployment options that can be reconfigured without an outage, are resilient to latency, and dynamically redirect to select another way in the event of an outage.					
- Connectivity that includes bi-directional, multi-hopped mesh communication possibilities which are Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant. 	

 Note: Registered means the nodes will be added in a group and deregistered means removing the node from the architecture. 
 Grouped and ungrouped means to add the nodes in a particular group name and changing is by just placing the hostname under a different group name. 

Automation mesh makes use of unique node types to create both the control and execution plane. Lets Learn more about the control and execution plane and their node types before designing your automation mesh topology.

The diagram that follows describes the functions of the control and execution plane as well as the node purpose belongs to the respective plane:

The above diagram shows all the Control plane architecture. Where it can be having the nodes as hybrid or control nodes or the mixture of both the nodes. 
The purpose of control nodes is to provide GUI to the user and the jobs gets executed on the execution nodes only whereas the Hybrid nodes are having the GUI as well as it can execute the jobs as well for the users.

The execution planes are mostly for executing the jobs and reporting the status of the jobs back to the control plane [control + hybrid nodes]. 

The hop nodes are only used in this to provide the communication between the execution nodes and the control plane whereas the execution nodes are used to execute the jobs: 

 Note: For an operator-based environment, there are no hybrid or control nodes. There is a concept called container groups, which make up containers running on the Kubernetes cluster. That comprises the control plane. That control plane is local to the Kubernetes cluster in which Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform is deployed.
