= Automation Mesh

Any application that is expected to scale globally needs reliable communication between its components. In Ansible Automation Platform, Automation Mesh is the feature that enables such inter-component communication.

Automation Mesh is an overlay network designed to enable the allocation of work among a sizable and scattered group of workers known as Execution Nodes. This is achieved by creating peer-to-peer connections between nodes over the existing networks. Receptor is the service that manages these connections.

Automation Mesh communications are encrypted with TLS, which allows securing traffic that moves across external networks, such as the Internet, and enables AAP to achieve the following:

- Nodes may be created, registered, grouped, ungrouped, and deregistered with less downtime thanks to the ability to change cluster capacity dynamically.
  Note: Register means introducing a node to the architecture and adding it to its first group, deregister means completely removing node from the architecture. Group/ungroup means adding/removing node to/from a particular group. 

- Control and Execution Plane separation enables scaling playbook execution capacity independently or using Control Plane capacity when required. 	
- Deployment options can be reconfigured without a downtime, jobs are resilient to latency and can be re-routed dynamically in the event of an outage.					
- Connectivity between the components is bi-directional, supports multi-hopped mesh communication and is Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant. 	

Automation Mesh uses node types to build Control and Execution Planes. It's important to understand these concepts and how they differ from conventional architecture to be able to design suitable Automation Mesh topology.

The following diagram describes the functions of the Control Plane and node types it consist of:

The next diagram shows nodes that can be part of the Execution Plane and their functions.

The purpose of Control nodes is to provide a GUI for users, run management tasks and trigger job execution. Once triggered, jobs are being run by the Execution nodes. Hybrid nodes, on the other hand, can perform either of these tasks.

The main purpose of the Execution Plane is to run jobs and report their status back to the Control Plane (i.e. back to Control or Hybrid nodes).

Hop nodes are used to provide the communication between the Control nodes and Execution nodes in cases when direct communication is not possible. 

Note: Operator-based environments (such as deployments on OpenShift), have no Hybrid or Control nodes. These deployments use Container Groups, which make up containers running on the Kubernetes cluster. That comprises the Control Plane local to the Kubernetes cluster where Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform is deployed.
