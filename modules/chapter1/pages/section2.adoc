= Automation Mesh Example 

Let us talk about the Automation mesh in RPM and Containerized installation:

*RPM*

The important part is how to make connections between the nodes which is also known as peering. Peer relationships define node-to-node connections. You can define peers within the [automationcontroller] and [execution_nodes] groups or using the [automationcontroller:vars] or [execution_nodes:vars] groups with peers=<node-name-to-connect-too>				

Let us create an example of 2 Deployment structures which will help you understand the above concept better: 


. Creating a simple 1 controller node connected to the 1 execution node with 1 Unified UI node and the database nodes is mandatory to have. So the below example only shares the information related to that.

Ansible automation platform in the above had nodes Automation Controller/execution, Unified UI and Database.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
[automationcontroller]
control_hostname.example.com

[automationcontroller:vars]
node_type=hybrid
peers=execution_nodes

[execution_nodes]
execution_hostname.example.com
----

In the above example we can see that there is 1 Automation Controller node mentioned as a node_type= control which acts as a control node to execute jobs on the execution nodes. 

. Creating a 1 hop node and 1 execution node connected to the hop node and the other execution node directly connected to the Automation Controller node.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
[automationcontroller]
control_hostname.example.com

[automationcontroller:vars]
node_type=hybrid
peers=execution

[execution_nodes]
execution_hostname1.example.com peers=proxy
execution_hostname2.example.com
execution_hop.example.com node_type=hop


[execution]
execution_hostname2.example.com

[proxy:vars]
peers=automationcontroller

[proxy]
execution_hop.example.com
----

The `execution_nodes` group helps the AAP installer script to understand how to install software to make that node work as an execution node for the AAP and the `[execution]` group will tell the script about the peering and how it needs to be done to the automation controller. 

For more information on the different types of architectures that can be made with the help of https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/automation_mesh_for_vm_environments/design-patterns#mesh-segregated-execution[automation mesh,windows=_blank].

*Containerized*

In `Containerized`` to create the nodes execution or hop we use the `receptor_type`` value which can be either execution or hop, while the `receptor_protocol`` is either tcp or udp. By default, the nodes in the `execution_nodes`` group are added as peers for the controller node. However, you can change the peer's configuration by using the receptor_peers variable. 	

For execution node: 

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
[execution_nodes]
execution_hostname.example.com
----

For hop node:			

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
[execution_nodes]
execution_hostname2.example.com
hop_hostname2.example.com receptor_type=hop receptor_peers='["execution_hostname2.example.com"]'
----

 NOTE: The execution and hop concept remains the same only the deployment will be different as you have to use receptor_type instead of node_type.
